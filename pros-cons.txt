Pros of the Database Structure -

1. I have made 2 separate tables for team names and match details to reduce data redundancy.
2. I have used foreign keys to link Matches and Teams table, which makes valid data relationships.
3. I have used if statements that checks whether the data already exists, cause without them the data will keep on getting added whenever the website refreshes and insertData() function runs.

Cons of the Database Structure -

1. It is a little difficult to understand query writing cause of Dependency on team_id.
2. This project is not good for large scale data due to manual input.
3. It will be very complicated to change team IDs due to dependency on them.
